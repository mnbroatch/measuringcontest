I don't share your data with third parties.

I do use google login, and they probably do sell your data, but it's data they already have and I'm not giving it to them.

Google as part of the login process might give me some of your personal data. I promise to ignore it. I only use the unique user id supplied by google to tell my users apart.

I won't share data about how you use the site, except to the extent that storing something in a cloud database is sharing it with the cloud service. But it's encrypted and stuff; I wouldn't be too worried about that. I'll just say, please refrain from doing anything on my site that would make you that paranoid.
