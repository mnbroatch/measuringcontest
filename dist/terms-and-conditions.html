I'm not liable for anything that happens as a result of you using this website.

In return, I will not act maliciously as the operator of this site.

Non-exhaustive list of things that I am not responsible for:
  - I accidentally use a third-party code library with some malware in it
  - I don't update the site and visiting old sites causes futuristic computers to break
  - I link to someone else's site and it becomes malicious later
  - Amazon Web Services goes crazy and every other website now hurts you
  - I am just straight-up hacked by a l33t h4xx0r
  - You hate the site so much that you die of apoplexy
  - You love the site so much that nothing else in this world can compare
  - Global warming (just kidding, we're all responsible)

This is all subject to change at my whim.
