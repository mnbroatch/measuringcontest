- Front end only screen: edit game
  - Not in lobby? "Create Game" button becomes "Create Lobby"
    - "Create Game" should be "Start Game"
  - In lobby? Same as now but editor is hidden behind toggle.
  - both: let's change websocket to only send to roomgame on save; as cool as realtime editing was, a "cancel" button is more useful
  - save to local storage where we currently save to roomgame





todo:
change every target to every targets tictactoe
clicking fast on reversi lets player 1 take 2 turns (quirk of single player mode?)
setState validation 
{"message":"The incoming token has expired"}
validate numPlayers against rule def
check: did I actually authenticate against using client token for gameserver rest API or did I hallucinate that?
  - in other words, is REST API actually only available from gateway?
test whether authentication prevents unauthenticated people from joining (and not just acting)
delete game
delete game from server on room delete
"finish game" logic
  - handle game being deleted and api giving blank (currently corrupt) json
check for handling of weird characters in game name, esp. quotes
useles apigw url path paramter configs?
can't have creator leave game

add separate spectator route?
hide game if not joined room
handle auto join if going from room not joined to room joined
