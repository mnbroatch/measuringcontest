todo:
delete game from server on room delete
"finish game" logic


(really just add separate spectator route?)
hide game if not joined room
handle auto join if going from room not joined to room joined

perPlayer: true just gets transformed at creation time to variants: { '0': { player: '0' }, '1': { player: '1' } }
variants get turned into their own bespoke entity with their own bank
{
  name: "thing-variantname"
  metadata: { parentName: 'thing', variantName: 'variantname' }
}
